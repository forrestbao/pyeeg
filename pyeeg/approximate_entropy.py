def ap_entropy(X, M, R):
    """Computer approximate entropy (ApEN) of series X, specified by M and R.

    Suppose given time series is X = [x(1), x(2), ... , x(N)]. We first build
    embedding matrix Em, of dimension (N-M+1)-by-M, such that the i-th row of
    Em is x(i),x(i+1), ... , x(i+M-1). Hence, the embedding lag and dimension
    are 1 and M-1 respectively. Such a matrix can be built by calling pyeeg
    function as Em = embed_seq(X, 1, M). Then we build matrix Emp, whose only
    difference with Em is that the length of each embedding sequence is M + 1

    Denote the i-th and j-th row of Em as Em[i] and Em[j]. Their k-th elements
    are Em[i][k] and Em[j][k] respectively. The distance between Em[i] and
    Em[j] is defined as 1) the maximum difference of their corresponding scalar
    components, thus, max(Em[i]-Em[j]), or 2) Euclidean distance. We say two
    1-D vectors Em[i] and Em[j] *match* in *tolerance* R, if the distance
    between them is no greater than R, thus, max(Em[i]-Em[j]) <= R. Mostly, the
    value of R is defined as 20% - 30% of standard deviation of X.

    Pick Em[i] as a template, for all j such that 0 < j < N - M + 1, we can
    check whether Em[j] matches with Em[i]. Denote the number of Em[j],
    which is in the range of Em[i], as k[i], which is the i-th element of the
    vector k. The probability that a random row in Em matches Em[i] is
    \simga_1^{N-M+1} k[i] / (N - M + 1), thus sum(k)/ (N - M + 1),
    denoted as Cm[i].

    We repeat the same process on Emp and obtained Cmp[i], but here 0<i<N-M
    since the length of each sequence in Emp is M + 1.

    The probability that any two embedding sequences in Em match is then
    sum(Cm)/ (N - M +1 ). We define Phi_m = sum(log(Cm)) / (N - M + 1) and
    Phi_mp = sum(log(Cmp)) / (N - M ).

    And the ApEn is defined as Phi_m - Phi_mp.


    Notes
    -----
    Please be aware that self-match is also counted in ApEn.

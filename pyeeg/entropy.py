def ap_entropy(X, M, R):
    """Computer approximate entropy (ApEN) of series X, specified by M and R.

    Suppose given time series is X = [x(1), x(2), ... , x(N)]. We first build
    embedding matrix Em, of dimension (N-M+1)-by-M, such that the i-th row of
    Em is x(i),x(i+1), ... , x(i+M-1). Hence, the embedding lag and dimension
    are 1 and M-1 respectively. Such a matrix can be built by calling pyeeg
    function as Em = embed_seq(X, 1, M). Then we build matrix Emp, whose only
    difference with Em is that the length of each embedding sequence is M + 1

    Denote the i-th and j-th row of Em as Em[i] and Em[j]. Their k-th elements
    are Em[i][k] and Em[j][k] respectively. The distance between Em[i] and
    Em[j] is defined as 1) the maximum difference of their corresponding scalar
    components, thus, max(Em[i]-Em[j]), or 2) Euclidean distance. We say two
    1-D vectors Em[i] and Em[j] *match* in *tolerance* R, if the distance
    between them is no greater than R, thus, max(Em[i]-Em[j]) <= R. Mostly, the
    value of R is defined as 20% - 30% of standard deviation of X.

    Pick Em[i] as a template, for all j such that 0 < j < N - M + 1, we can
    check whether Em[j] matches with Em[i]. Denote the number of Em[j],
    which is in the range of Em[i], as k[i], which is the i-th element of the
    vector k. The probability that a random row in Em matches Em[i] is
    \simga_1^{N-M+1} k[i] / (N - M + 1), thus sum(k)/ (N - M + 1),
    denoted as Cm[i].

    We repeat the same process on Emp and obtained Cmp[i], but here 0<i<N-M
    since the length of each sequence in Emp is M + 1.

    The probability that any two embedding sequences in Em match is then
    sum(Cm)/ (N - M +1 ). We define Phi_m = sum(log(Cm)) / (N - M + 1) and
    Phi_mp = sum(log(Cmp)) / (N - M ).

    And the ApEn is defined as Phi_m - Phi_mp.


    Notes
    -----
    Please be aware that self-match is also counted in ApEn.

    Notes
    ----------
    Suppose the given time series is X =[x(1),x(2),x(3),...,x(N)].
    We first build embedding matrix Em, of dimension(n*N-n+1),
    such that the ith row of Em is x(i),x(i+1),..x(i+n-1). Hence
    the embedding lag and the embedding dimension are 1 and n
    respectively. We build this matrix from a given time series,
    X, by calling pyEEg function embed_seq(x,1,n).

    We then transform each row of the embedding matrix into
    a new sequence, comprising a set of integers in range of 0,..,n-1.
    The order in which the integers are placed within a row is the
    same as those of the original elements:0 is placed where the smallest
    element of the row was and n-1 replaces the largest element of the row.

    To calculate the Permutation entropy, we calculate the entropy of PeSeq.
    In doing so, we count the number of occurrences of each permutation
    in PeSeq and write it in a sequence, RankMat. We then use this sequence to
    calculate entropy by using Shannon's entropy formula.

    Permutation entropy is usually calculated with n in range of 3 and 7.

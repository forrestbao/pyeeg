def spectral_entropy(X, Band, Fs, Power_Ratio=None):
    """Compute spectral entropy of a time series from either two cases below:
    1. X, the time series (default)
    2. Power_Ratio, a list of normalized signal power in a set of frequency
    bins defined in Band (if Power_Ratio is provided, recommended to speed up)

    In case 1, Power_Ratio is computed by bin_power() function.

    Notes
    -----
    To speed up, it is recommended to compute Power_Ratio before calling this
    function because it may also be used by other functions whereas computing
    it here again will slow down.

    Parameters
    ----------

    Band
        list

        boundary frequencies (in Hz) of bins. They can be unequal bins, e.g.
        [0.5,4,7,12,30] which are delta, theta, alpha and beta respectively.
        You can also use range() function of Python to generate equal bins and
        pass the generated list to this function.

        Each element of Band is a physical frequency and shall not exceed the
        Nyquist frequency, i.e., half of sampling frequency.

     X
        list

        a 1-D real time series.

    Fs
        integer

        the sampling rate in physical frequency

    Returns
    -------

    As indicated in return line

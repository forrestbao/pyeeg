PyEEG, a Python module to extract EEG feature.

Project homepage: http://pyeeg.org

**Data structure**

PyEEG only uses standard Python and numpy data structures,
so you need to import numpy before using it.
For numpy, please visit http://numpy.scipy.org

**Naming convention**

I follow "Style Guide for Python Code" to code my program
http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/

Constants: UPPER_CASE_WITH_UNDERSCORES, e.g., SAMPLING_RATE, LENGTH_SIGNAL.

Function names: lower_case_with_underscores, e.g., spectrum_entropy.

Variables (global and local): CapitalizedWords or CapWords, e.g., Power.

If a variable name consists of one letter, I may use lower case, e.g., x, y.

    Suppose given time series is X = [x(1), x(2), ... , x(N)]. We first build
    embedding matrix Em, of dimension (N-M+1)-by-M, such that the i-th row of
    Em is x(i),x(i+1), ... , x(i+M-1). Hence, the embedding lag and dimension
    are 1 and M-1 respectively. Such a matrix can be built by calling pyeeg
    function as Em = embed_seq(X, 1, M). Then we build matrix Emp, whose only
    difference with Em is that the length of each embedding sequence is M + 1

    Denote the i-th and j-th row of Em as Em[i] and Em[j]. Their k-th elements
    are Em[i][k] and Em[j][k] respectively. The distance between Em[i] and
    Em[j] is defined as 1) the maximum difference of their corresponding scalar
    components, thus, max(Em[i]-Em[j]), or 2) Euclidean distance. We say two
    1-D vectors Em[i] and Em[j] *match* in *tolerance* R, if the distance
    between them is no greater than R, thus, max(Em[i]-Em[j]) <= R. Mostly, the
    value of R is defined as 20% - 30% of standard deviation of X.

    Pick Em[i] as a template, for all j such that 0 < j < N - M + 1, we can
    check whether Em[j] matches with Em[i]. Denote the number of Em[j],
    which is in the range of Em[i], as k[i], which is the i-th element of the
    vector k. The probability that a random row in Em matches Em[i] is
    \simga_1^{N-M+1} k[i] / (N - M + 1), thus sum(k)/ (N - M + 1),
    denoted as Cm[i].

    We repeat the same process on Emp and obtained Cmp[i], but here 0<i<N-M
    since the length of each sequence in Emp is M + 1.

    The probability that any two embedding sequences in Em match is then
    sum(Cm)/ (N - M +1 ). We define Phi_m = sum(log(Cm)) / (N - M + 1) and
    Phi_mp = sum(log(Cmp)) / (N - M ).

    And the ApEn is defined as Phi_m - Phi_mp.

    -----
    Please be aware that self-match is also counted in ApEn.

    """Compute Detrended Fluctuation Analysis from a time series X and length of
    boxes L.

    The first step to compute DFA is to integrate the signal. Let original
    series be X= [x(1), x(2), ..., x(N)].

    The integrated signal Y = [y(1), y(2), ..., y(N)] is obtained as follows
    y(k) = \sum_{i=1}^{k}{x(i)-Ave} where Ave is the mean of X.

    The second step is to partition/slice/segment the integrated sequence Y
    into boxes. At least two boxes are needed for computing DFA. Box sizes are
    specified by the L argument of this function. By default, it is from 1/5 of
    signal length to one (x-5)-th of the signal length, where x is the nearest
    power of 2 from the length of the signal, i.e., 1/16, 1/32, 1/64, 1/128,
    ...

    In each box, a linear least square fitting is employed on data in the box.
    Denote the series on fitted line as Yn. Its k-th elements, yn(k),
    corresponds to y(k).

    For fitting in each box, there is a residue, the sum of squares of all
    offsets, difference between actual points and points on fitted line.

    F(n) denotes the square root of average total residue in all boxes when box
    length is n, thus
    Total_Residue = \sum_{k=1}^{N}{(y(k)-yn(k))}
    F(n) = \sqrt(Total_Residue/N)

    The computing to F(n) is carried out for every box length n. Therefore, a
    relationship between n and F(n) can be obtained. In general, F(n) increases
    when n increases.

    Finally, the relationship between F(n) and n is analyzed. A least square
    fitting is performed between log(F(n)) and log(n). The slope of the fitting
    line is the DFA value, denoted as Alpha. To white noise, Alpha should be
    0.5. Higher level of signal complexity is related to higher Alpha.

    Parameters
    ----------

    X:
        1-D Python list or numpy array
        a time series

    Ave:
        integer, optional
        The average value of the time series

    L:
        1-D Python list of integers
        A list of box size, integers in ascending order

    Returns

    Alpha:
        integer

        vs. log(n). where n is the

    Notes
    -----

    This value depends on the box sizes very much. When the input is a white
    noise, this value should be 0.5. But, some choices on box sizes can lead to
    the value lower or higher than 0.5, e.g. 0.38 or 0.58.

    Based on many test, I set the box sizes from 1/5 of    signal length to one
    (x-5)-th of the signal length, where x is the nearest power of 2 from the
    length of the signal, i.e., 1/16, 1/32, 1/64, 1/128, ...

    You may generate a list of box sizes and pass in such a list as a
    parameter.

       permutation entropy

    Notes
    ----------
    Suppose the given time series is X =[x(1),x(2),x(3),...,x(N)].
    We first build embedding matrix Em, of dimension(n*N-n+1),
    such that the ith row of Em is x(i),x(i+1),..x(i+n-1). Hence
    the embedding lag and the embedding dimension are 1 and n
    respectively. We build this matrix from a given time series,
    X, by calling pyEEg function embed_seq(x,1,n).

    We then transform each row of the embedding matrix into
    a new sequence, comprising a set of integers in range of 0,..,n-1.
    The order in which the integers are placed within a row is the
    same as those of the original elements:0 is placed where the smallest
    element of the row was and n-1 replaces the largest element of the row.

    To calculate the Permutation entropy, we calculate the entropy of PeSeq.
    In doing so, we count the number of occurrences of each permutation
    in PeSeq and write it in a sequence, RankMat. We then use this sequence to
    calculate entropy by using Shannon's entropy formula.

    Permutation entropy is usually calculated with n in range of 3 and 7.

        Information based similarity


    Notes
    ----------
    Information based similarity is a measure of dissimilarity between
    two time series. Let the sequences be x and y. Each sequence is first
    replaced by its first ordered difference(Encoder). Calculating the
    Heaviside of the resulting sequences, we get two binary sequences,
    SymbolicSeq. Using PyEEG function, embed_seq, with lag of 1 and dimension
    of n, we build an embedding matrix from the latter sequence.

    Each row of this embedding matrix is called a word. Information based
    similarity measures the distance between two sequence by comparing the
    rank of words in the sequences; more explicitly, the distance, D, is
    calculated using the formula:

    "1/2^(n-1) * sum( abs(Rank(0)(k)-R(1)(k)) * F(k) )" where Rank(0)(k)
    and Rank(1)(k) are the rank of the k-th word in each of the input
    sequences. F(k) is a modified "shannon" weighing function that increases
    the weight of each word in the calculations when they are more frequent in
    the sequences.

    It is advisable to calculate IBS for numerical sequences using 8-tupple
    words.

       Largest Lyapunov Exponent

    Notes
    ----------
    A n-dimensional trajectory is first reconstructed from the observed data by
    use of embedding delay of tau, using pyeeg function, embed_seq(x, tau, n).
    Algorithm then searches for nearest neighbour of each point on the
    reconstructed trajectory; temporal separation of nearest neighbours must be
    greater than mean period of the time series: the mean period can be
    estimated as the reciprocal of the mean frequency in power spectrum

    Each pair of nearest neighbours is assumed to diverge exponentially at a
    rate given by largest Lyapunov exponent. Now having a collection of
    neighbours, a least square fit to the average exponential divergence is
    calculated. The slope of this line gives an accurate estimate of the
    largest Lyapunov exponent.
